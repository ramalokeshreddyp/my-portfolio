## Setup And Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Local Setup
1. Clone repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramalokeshreddyp/PRLR-PROFILE.git
cd PRLR-PROFILE
```

2. Install dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server.
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open local app.
```text
http://localhost:8080/
```

## How To Run Locally
```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server
npm run build    # Production build
npm run preview  # Preview built app
npm run lint     # Lint checks
```

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the home page and navigate section-by-section.
2. Use `Back to Top`, scroll progress, and section visuals for navigation.
3. Open chatbot from the floating button.
4. Ask portfolio-grounded questions like:
   - `What are your skills?`
   - `Tell me about your projects`
   - `What certifications do you have?`
   - `How can I contact you?`
5. Open `/resume` route for embedded resume preview and Drive actions.

## Design Principles
- Dark-mode-only visual language for consistency.
- Motion with purpose: transitions support readability and interaction feedback.
- Information hierarchy first: sections are organized to support recruiter scanning.
- Maintainability: business data and UI behavior are separated (`lib/` vs `components/`).

## Documentation Map
- `README.md`: quick onboarding + execution and usage view.
- `architecture.md`: deep architecture and design decisions.
- `projectdocumentation.md`: full technical and operational documentation.
